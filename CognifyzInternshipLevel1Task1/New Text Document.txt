Hello everyone! I’m Jogyalabharath, Frontend Development Intern at Cognifyz Technologies.

In this video, I’m going to present all the tasks I have completed for my internship.

📌 Level 1
I built a basic web page using HTML and then improved it using inline CSS for styling.

📌 Level 2
I made the webpage responsive using external CSS and media queries.
Then, I used JavaScript to add a button that changes the background color when clicked.

📌 Level 3
I implemented API integration using fetch() to dynamically display user data from a public API.
Next, I created a contact form with proper validation such as required fields and email format check.

📌 Level 4
I created a clean UI using Bootstrap for a professional design.
Finally, I used Sass for styling with variables, nesting, and compiling SCSS to CSS.

All tasks are completed successfully and structured level-wise in my project folder.
Thank you Cognifyz Technologies for this opportunity. I look forward to learning more during my internship journey!

Thank you for watching!
